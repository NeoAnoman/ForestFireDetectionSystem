# ForestFireDetectionSystem
 Google Inception V3 model used in this project in order to detect fire in the uploaded photo.  
 The dataset trains the model to deal with cases such as :-  
 1. Smoke and fog difference detection.  
 2. High Red color Intensity images seperation.  
 3. Detecting fires in the conjusted areas.  
#### Since, the dataset is limited there could be some false positives so, this is a model in making and have room for improvements.  
  
## Quick Demo
For a quick look in for the model please feel free to play the demoVideo.mp4 file provided in the project.  

## How to Run
Before running make sure you have installed tensorflow for keras and python to run the model in your system.  
After all dependencies you can simply run the ipynb file on your jupyter notebook.  
Please follow the demoVideo.mp4 in order to learn how to use the model.
